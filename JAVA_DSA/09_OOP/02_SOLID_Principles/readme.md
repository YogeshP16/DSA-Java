### SOLID Principles 

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **What**: A class should only have one job or responsibility.
   - **Why**: Makes code easier to maintain and understand.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces confusion and prevents changes from affecting multiple areas.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **What**: Classes should be open for new features but closed for changes.
   - **Why**: Allows extending code without modifying existing code.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces bugs by preventing unnecessary changes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **What**: A subclass should be able to replace its parent class without errors.
   - **Why**: Ensures subclasses don't break parent class behavior.
   - **Benefit**: Guarantees that derived classes will behave as expected.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **What**: Don't force a class to implement methods it doesn't need.
   - **Why**: Keeps interfaces simple and focused.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces unused code and simplifies maintenance.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - **What**: High-level code should not depend on low-level code. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - **Why**: Makes code more flexible and easier to test.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces tight coupling between modules and allows for easier changes.
