### **OOPS**
OOPS stands for **Object-Oriented Programming System**. It organizes code around **objects** rather than actions.  
- Objects are instances of **classes** (blueprints).  
- OOPS enables code **reuse**, easier **maintenance**, and better **scalability** by encapsulating data and behavior.

#### **Why we use:**
We use OOPS because it:
- **Simplifies Problem Solving:** Breaks big problems into smaller, manageable chunks (objects).  
- **Improves Code Reuse:** Write once, reuse many times (e.g., inheritance).  
- **Easier Debugging:** Isolate bugs within specific classes.  
- **Models Real-World Problems:** Works naturally with real-world entities (e.g., car, bank account).

#### **What it do:**
OOPS:
- Creates **blueprints** (classes) for real-world entities.
- Allows **objects** to interact with each other through methods.
- **Encapsulates** data so that implementation details are hidden.
- Follows principles like **inheritance**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism** for efficiency and scalability.

### **Class & Object:**
A class is a template that defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an object.
An object is an instance of a class, created using the new keyword in Java, superclass of all classes in Java..

#### **What It Does:**  
- Defines a structure for your program (class).  
- Creates independent working entities (objects) that use this structure.  

### **Methods (Instance vs Static)**   
- **Instance Method:** Belongs to an object. Needs an object to call it.  
- **Static Method:** Belongs to the class. Can be called without creating an object.  

#### **What It Does:**  
- **Instance Methods:** Perform actions using the unique data stored in an object.  
- **Static Methods:** Provide common functionality that isnâ€™t tied to any specific object.  

### **Key Differences Between Instance and Static Methods**

| **Aspect**            | **Instance Method**                    | **Static Method**                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Belongs To**         | A specific object                    | The class itself                     |
| **Requires Object?**   | Yes                                  | No                                    |
| **Access Instance Data?** | Yes                                  | No                                    |
| **Access Static Data?**   | Yes                                  | Yes                                   |
| **Example in Code**    | `myCar.drive()`                      | `Calculator.add(5, 10)`               |
