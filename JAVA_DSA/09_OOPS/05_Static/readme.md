### 1. **Static in Java**

#### **What is it?**
The keyword `static` in Java is used to define class-level members (variables, methods, or blocks), meaning they belong to the class rather than instances of the class.

#### **Why it's used?**
It allows shared access to variables or methods across all instances of a class. You don’t need to create an object to access them.

#### **What it does?**
- **Static Variables**: Shared by all instances of the class.
- **Static Methods**: Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- **Static Blocks**: Used to initialize static variables when the class is loaded.

#### **How it works?**
- **Static Variable**: When a variable is declared static, it's initialized only once, and all instances of the class share the same memory location for that variable.
- **Static Method**: A method declared as static can be called directly using the class name, without creating an object.

### 2. **Static Variables**

#### **What is it?**
A static variable is a class-level variable that is shared by all instances of the class.

#### **Why it's used?**
It’s used when you want to store data that is common to all instances of the class, like a counter that tracks the number of objects created.

#### **What it does?**
Every instance of the class has access to the same static variable.

#### **How it works?**
It’s initialized once when the class is loaded and retains its value across all instances.

### 3. **Static Methods**

#### **What is it?**
A method defined as `static` that can be invoked without creating an object of the class.

#### **Why it's used?**
Static methods are used when the behavior is not dependent on instance-specific data but rather on class-level data.

#### **What it does?**
Allows calling the method directly using the class name.

#### **How it works?**
Since static methods do not operate on instance variables, they can be accessed directly by the class name, and they cannot access non-static members without an object.

### 4. **Why `psvm` (main method) is static?**

#### **What is it?**
`psvm` stands for `public static void main(String[] args)` which is the entry point of any Java application.

#### **Why it's used?**
The `main` method needs to be static because it is called by the JVM before any objects are created. The JVM does not create an object to invoke the main method, so it must be static.

#### **What it does?**
It allows the JVM to call the method without creating an instance of the class.

#### **How it works?**
Since the `main` method is static, the JVM can invoke it directly when the program starts.

---

### 5. **Non-static Member Inside a Static Method**

#### **What is it?**
You cannot directly access non-static members (variables or methods) inside a static method because static methods don’t have access to instance data.

You can access by creating an instance of the class (Example obj = new Example();), the static method can access the non-static members using the object reference (obj.instanceVariable).

#### **Why it's used?**
Non-static members are tied to instances, so they require an object to be accessed.

#### **What it does?**
To access a non-static member inside a static method, you need to create an instance of the class.

#### **How it works?**
You can create an object in the static method and use it to access non-static members.

---

### 6. **Static Member Inside a Non-static Method**

#### **What is it?**
Static members (variables or methods) can be accessed directly in non-static methods because static members belong to the class.

#### **Why it's used?**
It allows access to class-level data inside instance methods.

#### **What it does?**
You can directly refer to static members in non-static methods without creating an instance of the class.

#### **How it works?**
Since static members are shared by all instances, they are directly available inside non-static methods.

---

### 7. **`this` Keyword Inside Static Methods**

#### **What is it?**
The `this` keyword refers to the current object.

#### **Why it's used?**
It is used to refer to the current instance of the class.

#### **What it does?**
Inside a static method, `this` cannot be used because static methods don’t belong to any specific instance.

#### **How it works?**
Since static methods are class-level methods, they cannot refer to the instance-specific context, which is what `this` represents.

---

### 8. **Initialization of Static Variables**

#### **What is it?**
Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded into memory.

#### **Why it's used?**
To ensure that static variables are initialized only once for the entire class.

#### **What it does?**
Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded by the JVM and remain the same across all instances.

#### **How it works?**
You can initialize static variables in a static block or directly at the point of declaration.

---

### 9. **Instance vs Static**

#### **What is it?**
Instance members are tied to an object, whereas static members are tied to the class itself.

#### **Why it's used?**
Use instance members when data is unique to an object, and static members when the data should be shared across all objects of the class.

#### **What it does?**
Instance members can only be accessed through an object, while static members can be accessed without creating an object.

#### **How it works?**
- Instance members require an object for access.
- Static members can be accessed directly using the class name.

---

### 10. **Inner Classes**

#### **What is it?**
An inner class is a class defined within another class.

#### **Why it's used?**
Used for logically grouping classes that are only used in one place, improving encapsulation.

#### **What it does?**
It allows the inner class to access the members (including private members) of the outer class.

#### **How it works?**
- **Non-static inner classes**: These can access both static and non-static members of the outer class.
- **Static nested classes**: These can only access static members of the outer class.

---

### 11. **Internal Working of Some Statements**

#### **What is it?**
The internal working refers to how the JVM interprets and executes Java statements.

#### **Why it's used?**
It helps understand how certain Java constructs behave when executed.

#### **What it does?**
- **`new` Keyword**: Creates an object of a class and allocates memory.
- **Control Statements (if, while)**: Directs the flow of execution based on conditions.

#### **How it works?**
The JVM compiles the Java code into bytecode, which is executed on the JVM. Statements like `if`, loops, or object creation get processed during runtime.
