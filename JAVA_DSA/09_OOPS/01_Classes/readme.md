### What is a Class in Java?

A **class** in Java is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. Imagine you're building a toy car. The blueprint tells you what parts the car needs (wheels, body, color), but it doesn't make the car itself. The **class** is like that blueprint, while an **object** is the actual car you build using that blueprint.

### Why is it Used?

We use a class to define what an object will look like and what it can do. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you can create many objects based on one class. This helps organize code and makes it easier to reuse.

### What Does It Do?

A class defines:
- **Properties**: These are like the features of the toy car (e.g., color, size, speed).
- **Methods**: These are like the actions or behaviors of the toy car (e.g., move, stop, honk).

### How It Works?

A class has two main parts:
1. **Fields (Properties)**: These are variables inside the class that hold the values describing the object.
   - Example: In a `Car` class, you could have `color`, `speed`, and `model` as fields.
   
2. **Methods (Behaviors)**: These are functions that define what the object can do.
   - Example: In the `Car` class, a method could be `startEngine()` to start the car or `accelerate()` to make it go faster.

### Example:

```java
class Car {
    // Fields (Properties)
    String color;
    int speed;
    
    // Methods (Behaviors)
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }

    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Car is speeding up!");
    }
}
```

Here:
- **Class Name**: `Car`
- **Fields**: `color` (color of the car), `speed` (how fast the car is going)
- **Methods**: `startEngine()` and `accelerate()` (things the car can do)

### In Short:
- A **class** is like a set of instructions to create an object.
- It has **properties** (what the object has) and **methods** (what the object can do).
- We use it to avoid repeating the same code, making it easier to manage and modify.
